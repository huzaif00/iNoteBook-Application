# iNoteBook

This is a Full Stack Notebook application built with the MERN Stack. The application begins by allowing users to sign up, and it utilizes an API (built using Express) to store user details in MongoDB. Once a user has signed up, they can log in to our application. For the login process, we authenticate the user using the details stored in MongoDB. Each user is assigned a unique token and ID. We use the token for authentication, and the ID is used to store their notes separately from others. In this application, no user can see notes belonging to other users.

## Technology Used
.React js - For Frontend Task
.Express js - For Building APIs, Authentication
.MongoDB - Used For Storing Data of users and their notes
